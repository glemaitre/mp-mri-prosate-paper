\begin{abstract}
    Study the advantages of using multi-modal imagery in computer-aided
    detection and diagnosis systems for prostate cancer with special attention to
    pre-processing and data-balancing stages of a CaD.
%
    A multi modal MR volumes including T2W-MRI, DCE-MRI, DW-MRI and MRSI with
    accompanying ground-truth were acquired from 17 patients. The proposed CaD
    system to conduct this study consists of pre-processing, segmentation, feature
    detection, data balancing, feature extraction and classification;
    and all results are cross-validated using leave one patient out strategy.
%
    The usage of multi-modal information to the CaD system increases the area
    under the curve from $0.666\pm0.15$ up to $0.836\pm0.083$, showing a better
    and more stable results.
%
    The study using the proposed framework shows that T2W-MRI is necessary to
    obtain satisfactory results however better results are obtained when combined
    with other modalities.
    % More-over the study also shows that the reliability of any modality is
    % strongly linked to the pre-processing and balancing of the data.

\section{Introduction}

\Ac{cap} is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in men, accounting for
899,000 cases and leading to 258,100 deaths per
year~\citep{ferlay2010estimates}. As highlighted by the PI-RADS Steering
Committee, the two main challenges to be addressed are~\citep{weinreb2016pi}:
(i) improving the detection of clinically significant \ac{cap}
and (ii) increasing confidence in benign or dormant cases and therefore avoiding
unnecessary invasive medical exams. In this regard, \ac{mpmri} is frequently
used to build robust \ac{cad} systems to detect, localize, and grade \ac{cap}.
In general, \ac{cad} systems are based on \ac{mpmri} which potentially combines
several of the following modalities~\citep{lemaitre2015computer}:
\ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, \ac{adc} maps, and \ac{mrsi}.

\emph{Semi-quantitative} approaches are mathematical rather than pharmacokinetic because no pharmacokinetic assumptions regarding the relationship between the \ac{mri} signal and the contrast agent are made~\citep{huisman2001accurate,gliozzi2011phenomenological}.
These methods are advantageous because they do not require any knowledge of the \ac{mri} sequence or any conversion from signal intensity to concentration.
However, they present some limitations: the heuristic approach
proposed by \citeauthor{huisman2001accurate} requires an initial
estimate of the standard deviation of the signal noise and some manual tuning.

Nevertheless, all of the presented methods suffer from the following two major drawbacks:
(i) inter-patient variability and (ii) loss of information.
The inter-patient variability is mainly due to the acquisition process
and consequently leads to generalization issues in applying a machine learning algorithm.
All previous methods extract few discriminative parameters to describe the \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} signal which might lead to a loss of information.
%(i) the inter-patient variability of the data lead to a variation of the parameters estimated and subsequently to poor classification performance while designing \ac{cad} systems, and
%(ii) only few parameters are used to characterize the dynamic signal implying that some information are discarded.

In this work, we propose a fully automatic normalization method for \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} that reduces the inter-patient variability of the data.
The benefit and simplicity of our approach will be demonstrated by
classifying the whole normalized \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} signal and
comparing it with state-of-the-art quantitative and semi-quantitative methods.
Additionally, we will show that using this normalization approach in conjunction with the quantitative methods improves the classification performance of most of the models.
We also propose a new clustering-based method to discern enhanced
signals from the arteries that can, later be used to estimate an
\ac{aif} and provide an alternative approach to estimate the parameters of the semi-quantitative model proposed by~\cite{huisman2001accurate}.
